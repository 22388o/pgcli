CHANGELOG
=========

0.19: 2014-09-30
----------------
Fixed:
- Handle Jedi crashes.
- Autocompletion in `ptipython`
- Input validation in `ptipython`
- Execution of system commands (in `ptpython`) in Python 3
- Add current directory to sys.path for `ptpython`.
- Minimal jedi and six version in setup.py

New features
- Python 2.6 support
- C-C> and C-C< indent and unindent emacs key bindings.
- `ptpython` can now also run python scripts, so aliasing of `ptpython` as
  `python` will work better.

0.18: 2014-09-29
----------------
- First official (beta) release.
